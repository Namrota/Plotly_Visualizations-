# Plotly_Visualizations- visualization of Harold Shipman case study
Here we are using Plotly.garph_objects to visualize two datasets:
1) Records of all the victim's death by Harold Shipman.
2) Records of all the death hours recorded for Harold vs. other family doctor's patients

**Will be using v2 of the python file, since fig.show() is throwing error in Binder.
